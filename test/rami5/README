Running "make" will run SPARTACUS-Surface on five "actual" scenes from the RAMI-V intercomparison:

Note that the "urban" surface type is used to represent forests, with the tree trunks treated as buildings and other woody material (branches) merged into the vegetation properties.
The output netCDF files are placed in the out_nc directory. The Matlab script process_spartacus_scenes.m then converts the outputs into ASCII files for the RAMI-V submission.
