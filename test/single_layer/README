Calling make in this directory runs SPARTACUS-Surface on the
test_single_layer.nc file containing a single-layer description of an
urban canopy (i.e. all buildings the same height), with each column
increasing the mean building height so as to cover a very wide range
of street height-to-width ratios. Three solvers are applied,
controlled by the isurfacetype namelist parameter:

  Urban: the SPARTACUS solver with 8 diffuse streams per hemisphere

  InfiniteStreet: the Harman et al. (2004) method of performing the
    radiative transfer by solving a 2x2 matrix problem, and describing
    the urban canopy as a single-layer infinite street

  SimpleUrban: the Harman et al. (2004) method of solving a 2x2 matrix
    problem, but assuming exponential model of urban geometry (Hogan
    2019) as in the SPARTACUS method
