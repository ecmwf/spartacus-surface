FEATURES

Gas optics
Dump out inputs like in ecRad
Combine lw_spectral_props%calc_monochromatic_emission and calc_simple_spectrum_lw into one function call for broadband Planck function
Support implicit solvers, e.g. windows in TEB with very low heat capacity
Store norm_perims for verification

BUG FIXES

Fix use of veg_contact_fraction
test_surface_out.nc fails with number of veg regions = 1
Fix crash when vegetation region has zero vegetation extinction, esp. in single precision
Fix non-zero residual in urban longwave when nstream>=2

CHECK

Eigen decomposition correctly treats multiple spectral intervals
Separate temperatures for clear-air, veg-air and veg
Check that removing tan0 on line 332 does not break the RAMI4PILPS agreement
Longwave forest
Longwave urban
Computational cost w.r.t. ecRad and dependence on number of streams
