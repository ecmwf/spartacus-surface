## INTRODUCTION

This package contains the offline version of a scheme for computing
radiative transfer in complex 3D surface canopies, such as forests and
cities. It makes use of the "SPARTACUS" technique, originally
developed for clouds. By treating trees and buildings as randomly
distributed in the horizontal plane, their 3D structure may be
described statistically by a handful of geometric properties, such as
the tree or building cover, and the length of the interface between
tree crowns or building walls and clear air.  See Hogan et al. (2018)
and Hogan (2019) for full details of the algorithm, and their
validation.


## PACKAGE OVERVIEW

The subdirectories are as follows:

- `radsurf` - source code for radiative transfer in complex surfaces
       such as vegetation and urban areas

- `radtool` - source code for mathematical routines needed by the
       SPARTACUS algorithm

- `utilities` - source code for useful utilities, such as reading netCDF
       files

- `driver` - the source code for the offline driver program

- `mod` - where Fortran module files are written

- `lib` - where the static libraries are written

- `bin` - where the executable ecrad is written

- `test` - test cases including Matlab code to plot the outputs

- `doc` - LaTeX source for SPARTACUS-Surface documentation

## TO COMPILE

1. Ensure you have a Fortran compiler supporting the 2003
standard. Ensure you have the Fortran netCDF library installed
(version 3 or 4) for this compiler.  The command `nc-config --fc`, if
available on your system, will tell you the Fortran compiler that your
netCDF library was compiled for.

2. You can compile the code using 

       make PROFILE=<prof>

   where `<prof>` is one of gfortran, pgi or intel.  This will read
   the compiler-specific configurations from the file
   `Makefile_include.<prof>`.  If you omit the `PROFILE=` option then
   `gfortran` will be assumed. If you have a compiler other than these
   three then create such a file for your compiler following the
   example in `Makefile_include.gfortran`.

   If the compile is successful then static libraries should appear in
   the lib directory, and then the executable `bin/spartacus_surface`.

3. To clean-up, type `make clean`.  To build an unoptimized version
   for debugging, you can do

       make PROFILE=<prof> DEBUG=1

   or you can specifically override the variables in
   `Makefile_include.<prof>` using, for example

       make PROFILE=<prof> OPTFLAGS=-O0 DEBUGFLAGS="-g -pg"


## TO TEST

The offline driver is run via

    spartacus_surface <namelist.nam> <input_file.nc> <output_file.nc>

where the radiation scheme is configured using the Fortran namelist
file `<namelist.nam>`, and the inputs and outputs are in netCDF
format.

To run the tests, type

    make test

from the top-level directory.  This runs `make` in each of the
subdirectories of the test directory, which in turn runs
spartacus_surface on different input files.

The `test/simple` directory contains a minimal test file of the four
surface types that SPARTACUS-Surface supports: flat, forest,
unvegetated urban and vegetated urban.

The `test/rami4pilps` directory contains a configuration to run the
RAMI4PILPS test cases that were used by Hogan et al. (2018).

The `test/urban` directory contains an urban profile from Fig. 1 of
Hogan (2019).

The `test/rami5` directory contains the files necessary to run five of
the actual forest scenes from the RAMI-V intercomparison project.
